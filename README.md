# Homography & Epipolar Geometry Estimation

This project explores geometric relationships between multi-view images by estimating homography and fundamental matrices using both **manual point correspondences** and an **automated feature extraction pipeline**.

The work is divided into two phases:

- **Manual Feature Extraction and Matching**
- **Automated Feature Extraction and Matching**

Each phase is documented in its own subfolder with implementation code, experiments, and analysis results.
